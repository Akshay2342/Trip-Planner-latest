 # üèñ AI Trip Planner  

## üìå Overview  
Trippy is an intelligent travel planning application that generates personalized trip itineraries based on user preferences. By inputting details such as source, destination, number of days, budget, and preferred places of interest (e.g., historical sites, kid-friendly locations), users receive a well-structured travel plan tailored to their needs.  

Leveraging AI and machine learning, the planner optimizes the itinerary by considering factors like distance, travel time, and budget constraints. It ensures an efficient and enjoyable trip by providing recommendations for attractions, accommodations, dining options, and shopping recommendations.  

This project aims to simplify trip planning by automating the process and delivering a hassle-free experience for travelers.
